Welcome to my self-study course on computational chemistry and data analysis! This repository is designed as an accessible starting point for undergraduate students or early learners interested in applying computational methods to chemical problems. The course emphasizes practical, hands-on learning and is particularly valuable for those who lack prior research experience. It aims to demystify computational tools like [Pymatgen](https://pymatgen.org) and make them approachable for students outside of computer science disciplines.

## **Who Is This For?**
- Undergraduate students in chemistry or related fields.  
- Enthusiasts eager to explore computational tools without extensive prior knowledge of coding or computer science.  
- Learners interested in improving their ability to work with and analyze data in a chemistry context.  

## **Course Objectives**
- Introduce computational chemistry concepts and tools, focusing on practicality and ease of use.  
- Provide a scaffolded learning experience with clear progression from basics to more advanced applications.  
- Equip students with skills to manage, analyze, and visualize data effectively in Python.  

## **Structure of the Course**
This course is structured into modules, each containing the following components:
1. **Learning Material:**  
   Concise explanations of concepts, tools, and techniques.  
   
2. **Examples & Demos:**  
   Code snippets and walkthroughs showcasing applications in computational chemistry.  

3. **Practice Questions:**  
   Targeted questions to test your understanding of the material.  

4. **Assignments:**  
   Mini-projects or challenges designed to deepen your learning through application.  

5. **Solutions & Discussion:**  
   Suggested answers and explanations to help you reflect on your work.

## **Course Modules**
### **Module 1: Getting Started with Computational Tools**
- Overview of computational chemistry and its applications.  
- Installing Python.
- Setting up your Python environment.  
- Introduction to key libraries: `Pymatgen`, `Numpy`, `Pandas`, and `Matplotlib`.  

### **Module 2: Basics of Crystallography and Structure Analysis**  
- Representing crystal structures using `Pymatgen`.  
- Parsing and visualizing CIF files.  
- Different softwares.
- Basic symmetry operations, lattice parameters and jargon.  

### **Module 3: Analyzing Materials Data**  
- Extracting material properties.  
- Data cleaning and manipulation with `Pandas`.  
- Creating meaningful visualizations.  

### **Module 4: Automating Calculations???**  
- Setting up batch operations for structure generation.  
- Automating data extraction and analysis workflows.  

### **Module 5: Capstone Project**  
- Integrate everything you’ve learned to solve a real-world computational chemistry problem.  

## **Why This Approach Works**  
Many students find traditional computational chemistry resources intimidating, particularly those with heavy programming prerequisites. This course offers:  
- A **beginner-friendly** approach with no prior experience required.  
- **Hands-on practice** to build confidence and competence.  
- A **modular design** so you can learn at your own pace.

## **How to Use This Repository**
1. **Clone the Repository:**  
   ```bash
   $ git clone github.com/OliynykLab/Materials-Informatics-Courses.git
   $ pip install -r requirements.txt
   $ cd Materials-Informatics-Courses
   ```     
2. Follow the course modules in order or jump to topics of interest.  
3. Use the provided examples and demos to experiment and learn interactively.  
4. Complete assignments and explore optional challenges for deeper engagement.  

## **Acknowledgements**
This course was visualized by Dr. Oliynyk to expand computational techniques with an absolute-zero background. 
The shaping of this course was inspired by my experiences as an undergraduate student navigating computational 
research without prior exposure. I hope it serves as a valuable resource for anyone eager to dive into this field.
